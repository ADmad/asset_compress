0.13.0 Changes

* Added per install `.local.ini` config files. This allows you to store the
  build file descriptions in one file, and put environment specific
  configuration like platform specific paths to nodejs in a separate
  configuration file. Thanks QTSdev
* Added ClosureCompiler filter. This adds support for google's closure
  compiler webservice as a javascript minifier. Thanks jadb
