3.0.0 Changes

### Breaking Changes

* Dynamic build files and all features related to them have been removed.
  Dynamic build files presented a few challenges around maintenance and went
  against my goals of creating a fast and simple way to integrate all your
  asset pipeline features into one plugin.

See [github releases](https://github.com/markstory/asset_compress/releases)
for changelogs on previous releases.
